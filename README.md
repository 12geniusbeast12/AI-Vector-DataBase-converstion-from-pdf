# Structured Knowledge Systems

## Make AI Reason Before It Answers.

Traditional enterprise RAG builds fragile indexes behind expensive API paywalls. We are building the **Open Source Knowledge Operating System**.

Transform your static textbooks, complex documents, and dense research papers into active knowledge systems capable of true multi-hop synthesis, hierarchical understanding, and intent-aware reasoning. 

**100% Free. 100% Local. Zero Data Leaks.**

### Why Standard RAG Fails (And How We Fix It)

Most enterprise systems solve problems by throwing massive context windows and expensive API calls at models. **We optimize knowledge structure at the source.** 

By capturing the *exact* semantic geometry of your documents directly on your machine, we allow small, open-source AI models (like Llama 3 via Ollama) to reason like domain experts.

#### 🏛️ 1. Zero-Loss Layout Ingestion (Offline by Default)
Our local, on-device parsing reconstructs paragraphs, lists, tables, and source code using 2D geometric bounding boxes using PDFium. 
*   **Total Privacy:** Your data never leaves your RAM during extraction.
*   **Zero Cost:** No API fees to extract layout from complex PDFs.

#### 📍 2. Persistent Memory (Structural Breadcrumbs)
Eliminate context drift. The system always knows which chapter and section is being discussed, anchoring every retrieval to its logical location within the source material.

#### 🎯 3. Intent-Aware Retrieval
Is the user asking for a definition, a procedure, or an overview? Our adaptive scoring triggers specialized boosts based on user intent—matching queries like *"What is L1 cache?"* strictly to formal definitions instead of random commentary.

#### 🧠 4. Multi-Hop Synthesis
Solve the fragmented knowledge problem. When you need deep reasoning, our engine gathers context "islands" from across chapters and synthesizes them into a unified, hallucination-free technical narrative—powered entirely by local hardware.

### The Evolution of Open Source Retrieval

| Feature | Primitive Local RAG | Structured Knowledge OS | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Recall** | Flat Keyword Match | **Semantic Chunking & Intent** | *Higher precision* |
| **Logic** | Random Chunk Retrieval | **Hierarchical Understanding** | *True multi-hop synthesis* |
| **Context** | Lost across page limits | **Persistent Memory** | *Less hallucination* |
| **Coherence** | Broken mid-sentence | **Cognitive Units** | *Complete ideas preserved* |
| **Ingestion** | Lossy text extraction | **Layout-Aware Precision** | *Zero-loss structure* |

### Your Documents. Your Hardware. Your Rules.
Deploy locally natively on Windows. Decouple embeddings from reasoning with our **Dual-Engine Architecture**. Hook up LM Studio, Ollama, or any custom local API. Keep your knowledge perfectly private while achieving enterprise-grade synthesis.
